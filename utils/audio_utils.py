    Extracts Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from an audio file.

    # Load the audio file using librosa.
    # 'file_path' is the path to a .wav (or any compatible) audio file.
    # 'sr=None' ensures librosa uses the fileâ€™s original sampling rate rather than resampling it to the default (22050 Hz).
    #
    # Output:
    # - y: a 1D NumPy array containing the raw audio waveform (amplitude values over time).
    #      len(y) = sr * duration (in seconds)
    # - sr: the sampling rate (samples per second), which defines how many values exist per second of audio.

    # Key Parameters:
    # - y: the audio time series (waveform)
    # - sr: the sampling rate
    # - n_mfcc=13: number of MFCC coefficients to extract per frame
    #
    # Output:
    # - mfcc: a 2D NumPy array of shape (n_mfcc, T), where:
    #   - n_mfcc: number of coefficients (vertical axis, 13 rows)
    #   - T: number of time frames (horizontal axis, e.g., ~427 for a 10-second clip with 512 hop)
    # Each column of this matrix represents a "snapshot" of the sound's frequency characteristics at that time.
